## Changes in this fork

This fork focuses on **performance** and **bug fixes** for large media libraries. All changes are backwards-compatible and don't alter the user-facing UI design.

### Performance

- **Faster cold start**: lower background thread priority and skip filesystem checks for cached folders to reduce UI freezes on launch
- **Incremental folder scanning**: three-level media scanning strategy with targeted MediaProvider indexing instead of full filesystem walks
- **"Show all" optimization**: MediaStore batched queries on Android 11+ with DB diff-updates and write deduplication, skipping unnecessary folder scans
- **Search optimization**: generation tokens drop stale filter results; deletion path lookups use HashSet instead of list scans
- **Memory optimization**: path-only HashSet extraction instead of cloning full Medium lists during media refresh, with OOM recovery guards
- **`.nomedia` caching**: persist `.nomedia` status in DB to eliminate filesystem checks during folder filtering
- **Configurable debug logging**: toggle debug logging in Debug settings

### Bug fixes

- **UI lag during media scan** ([upstream issue #1092](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery/issues/1092), [PR #1115](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery/pull/1115)): batch directory adapter updates instead of calling `setupAdapter()` for every folder during cached directory refresh and new folder discovery — with many folders this flooded the UI thread, causing taps to be delayed or ignored
- **Zoom reset on image load** ([upstream issue #1101](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery/issues/1101), [PR #1117](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery/pull/1117)): fix zoom/pan loss when opening images and zooming before the full-resolution tile loads — replaced Glide-based decoder with direct BitmapFactory decoding, transfer zoom state from GestureImageView to SubsamplingScaleImageView with correct coordinate/scale transformation for EXIF-rotated images
- **Zoom reset on media list refresh** ([upstream issue #1101](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery/issues/1101), [PR #1117](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery/pull/1117)): fix zoom loss caused by the viewer's duplicate media load (cached for instant display, then fresh scan for accuracy) recreating the entire pager adapter and all fragments — the adapter is now reused in-place when the current item survives, with path-keyed fragment tracking, `getItemPosition` preserving same-position fragments, and fresh `Medium` metadata pushed to surviving fragments via `updateMedium()` without reloading (unless the file signature actually changed)
- **State corruption in MediaActivity**: move media list to instance field to prevent concurrent Activity instances from overwriting each other's state; add lifecycle guards to prevent background callbacks after onPause
- **Hidden/excluded folder bypass**: prevent hidden and excluded folders from bypassing visibility filters in MediaStore scans
- **Thumbnail/metadata refresh**: refresh directory thumbnails and metadata immediately after cover changes and deletions
- **Folder sort stability**: add secondary sort by location when primary sort values are equal (internal location first)
- **Media sort stability** ([upstream issue #1112](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery/issues/1112)): fall back to name sorting when media share the same date modified, date taken, or size — the tiebreaker follows the primary sort direction (e.g. descending date → Z-A within same date), replacing the previous unpredictable order
